Hello my name is Satvik Singh Kathuria and I have created a genre classifcation of an audio file and recommendation engine.
The genre classification and recommendation engine app allows the user to input an audio file and returns a genre of the file back to the user along with a recommendation. 
This is a great way to find new songs or even genres of music to listen to. 
The app has an option to open an audio file in which you can click on a file and submit it. This allows the app to find the path of the file and check its genre. 
The genre can then be revealed to you with the reveal genre button.
A graph will also pop up which will show the similarity of your audio file to the other audio files in the database.
The open file option will open a new window in which you are allowed to select a file from your device to put into the program.
The play button will allow you to play the audio file which you have inputted into the program using the open file button.
The reveal genre button will reveal the genre of the audio file when clicked.
